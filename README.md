# Pathfinding Visualizer

Welcome! This project was built to create an immersive experience where users of all backgrounds and ages can learn about pathfinding algorithms in a fun and innutitive manner.

I built this project to learn about web development and pathfinding algorithms.

## Here's the project! Enjoy!

## Features

This project currently focuses on four algorithms:

    A Star Search -> This search algorithm is weighted and uses a heuristic to measure the distance between the current cell and the target cell. Guarantees the shortest path.

    Dijkstra's Algorithm -> This search algorithm is weighted and keeps track of the shortest distances to the start point. Guarantees the shortest path.

    BFS (Breadth-First) Search -> This search algorithm is unweighted and searches in a predefined manner. Guarantees the shortest path.

    DFS (Depth-First) Search -> This search algorithm is unweighted and searches in a predefined manner. Does not guarantee the shortest path.

'Create Maze' button uses a Recursive Division Maze algorithm to generate walls in a maze pattern.

Click on cells to add walls.

Hold 'w' key while clicking on cells to add weight (cats). The cats make the path more treacherous and have a weight of 10.

Once search algorithm is done running, drag start or end point to automatically calculate new paths. Click on different algorithms to compare paths.
