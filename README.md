# Pathfinding Visualizer

Welcome! This project was built to create an immersive experience where users of all backgrounds and ages can learn about pathfinding algorithms in a fun and innutitive manner.

I built this project to learn about web development and pathfinding algorithms.

## Features

This project currently focuses on four algorithms:

    A Star Search -> This search algorithm is weighted and uses a heuristic to measure the distance between the current cell and the target cell. Guarantees the shortest path.

    Dijkstra's Algorithm -> This search algorithm is weighted and keeps track of the shortest distances to the start point. Guarantees the shortest path.

    BFS (Breadth-First) Search -> This search algorithm is unweighted and searches in a predefined manner. Guarantees the shortest path.

    DFS (Depth-First) Search -> This search algorithm is unweighted and searches in a predefined manner. Does not guarantee the shortest path.

'Create Maze' button uses a Recursive Division Maze algorithm to generate mazes.

Click on cells to add walls.

Once search algorithm is done running, drag start or end point to automatically calculate new paths. Click on different algorithms to compare paths.

## Here's the project! Enjoy!
